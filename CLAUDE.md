# claude.md

yo claude, this file is for you. try not to mess things up okay?

## what even is this

this is izam's personal website. it's literally just one html file. yes, one. don't go creatin' a bunch of react components or suggestin' we add typescript. am beggin' you.

## architecture (if you can even call it that)

- `index.html` - that's it. that's the whole website. html + css + js all shoved in one file like a burrito
- no frameworks. no webpack. no npm. no node_modules folder eatin' up 500mb of disk space
- deploys to github pages when you push to `main`. github actions handles it, not you

## how to develop

1. open `index.html` in browser
2. that's it. am not jokin'

don't you dare suggest settin' up a dev server or hot reloadin'. we don't do that here.

## style guide

- it's supposed to look ugly. it's inspired by motherfuckingwebsite.com. don't try to "improve" it
- no custom css. just vibin' with default browser styles like it's 1999
- the email is obfuscated with some rot13 nonsense so spambots don't find it. don't "fix" it thinkin' it's broken
- if you see inline styles, leave them alone. am not refactorin' 3 lines of css into a separate file

## things you should never do

- add a css framework
- suggest "maybe we could use tailwind here"
- create multiple files for "better organization"
- add comments explainin' what `<h1>` does

## final words

this website loads in like 0.001 seconds. let's keep it that way. am countin' on you claude. don't let me down.
