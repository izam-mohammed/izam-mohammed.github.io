# contributin'

so you wanna contribute to my personal website? that's... unexpected.

## when you can actually contribute

- you know somethin' about me that i don't know myself
- you found a typo or grammar mistake (my parents don't speak english and am a noob at it. please help.)
- you discovered am actually older or younger than i think i am
- you have proof that am secretly famous somewhere and just don't know it
- you found a bug in my age calculator and am actually livin' in the future

## how to contribute

1. fork this repo (why tho)
2. make your changes
3. open a pr with proof that you know me better than i know myself
4. wait for me to have an existential crisis
5. am either mergin' it or questionin' my entire life

## what not to contribute

- "improvements" to the design. it's supposed to look like this
- your own information. this is my website not yours. go make your own
- javascript frameworks. am beggin' you
- dark mode. we tried that. didn't vibe with it

## questions?

if you somehow know somethin' about me that i should know, just open an issue. am curious now.
